# HyperExpress: High Performance Node.js Webserver

## Fork Notes:

**Changes in this fork**

- This fork enables the ability to deregister routes while the server is running for dynamic processing
- Routed is now an instance of event emitter for event driven applications

## Motivation
HyperExpress aims to be a simple yet performant HTTP & Websocket Server. Combined with the power of uWebsockets.js, a Node.js binding of uSockets written in C++, HyperExpress allows developers to unlock higher throughput for their web applications with their existing hardware. This can allow many web applications to become much more performant on optimized data serving endpoints without having to scale hardware.

Some of the prominent highlights are:
- Simplified HTTP & Websocket API
- Server-Sent Events Support
- Multipart File Uploading Support
- Modular Routers & Middlewares Support
- Multiple Host/Domain Support Over SSL
- Limited Express.js API Compatibility Through Shared Methods/Properties

See [`> [Benchmarks]`](./docs/Benchmarks.md) for **performance metrics** against other webservers in real world deployments.

## Documentation
HyperExpress **requires** Node.js version `16+` and can be installed using Node Package Manager (`npm`).
```
npm i hyper-express
```
